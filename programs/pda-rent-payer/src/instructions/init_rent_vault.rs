/*
Explanation:
Purpose:
The init_rent_vault function initializes a PDA (rent_vault) by transferring lamports to it.
If rent_vault doesn't exist, the Solana runtime automatically creates a system-owned account at that address.

Key Steps:
The transfer instruction sends amount lamports from payer to rent_vault.
If the PDA doesnâ€™t exist, a new system account is created at the rent_vault address.

Usage of seeds and bump:
The rent_vault address is derived deterministically using seeds (b"rent_vault") and bump.
This ensures rent_vault always resolves to the same address.
